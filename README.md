### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My main areas of interest are multi-cluster, networking, performance, eBPF and AI.

The most active project in my github corner is [k8s-multi-cluster](https://github.com/olga-mir/k8s-multi-cluster) where I write Golang tool to explore multi-cluster features with Cluster API (CAPI) and Cilium - Cluster High Availability (HA), Disaster Recovery (DR), failover, Cluster Mesh and more.

Lately I am more active with short demos and experiments trying out various tech:

[k8s](https://github.com/olga-mir/k8s) - standalone k8s clusters on AWS and GCP, provitioned with terraform, kOps, gcloud, etc.

[experiments](https://github.com/olga-mir/experiments) - any non-k8s technology that I find interesting to explore

I am presenting at conferences and meetups, you can find my talks archive [here](https://olga-mir.github.io/)
