### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Melbourne-based Platform Engineer with soft spot for all things Kubernetes. My areas of interest are multi-cluster, networking, performance, eBPF and, recently, AI.

The most active project here is [k8s-multi-cluster](https://github.com/olga-mir/k8s-multi-cluster) where I write Golang tool to explore multi-cluster features with Cluster API (CAPI) and Cilium - Cluster High Availability (HA), Disaster Recovery (DR), failover, Cluster Mesh and more.


Other auxiliary projects that I tinker with:

[k8s](https://github.com/olga-mir/k8s) - standalone k8s clusters on AWS and GCP, provitioned with terraform, kOps, gcloud, etc.

[experiments](https://github.com/olga-mir/experiments) - any non-k8s technology that I find interesting to explore


I also give talks mostly on Kubernetes related topic at local meetups and conferences:

* [Lessons Learned Running GKE Clusters on Spot Instances](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon23apac/presentation/mirensky) at [SRECon APAC 2023, Singapore](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon23apac)
* [Managing Kubernetes on Spot Instances](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-australia-presents-kubernetes-community-day-australia-2023/) at Australia first Kubernetes Community Days 2023.
* Local meetups - SRE Meetup, Infracoders.


When I am not glued to my screen, I enjoy long distance running and camping.
