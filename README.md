### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Melbourne-based Platform Engineer with soft spot for all things Kubernetes. I am especially interested in networking, performance and low level Linux, however this is not main part of my day job currently.

I'm experimenting with Cluster API and learning Cilium here: https://github.com/olga-mir/k8s-multi-cluster

When I am not glued to my screen, I enjoy long distance running and camping.
